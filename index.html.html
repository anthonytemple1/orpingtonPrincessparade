    <h2>1. Introduction &amp; Scope</h2>
    <p>This report summarises the condition of the retail premises known as Units 5‑6 Princess Parade, Crofton Road, Orpington, BR6.  The survey was carried out on <strong>22 July 2025</strong> and covers the building fabric, mechanical, electrical and plumbing (MEP) systems, extra‑low voltage services, energy performance and maintenance considerations.  Our assessment is based on a visual inspection and review of available records; no invasive investigations were undertaken.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="description">
    <h2>2. Property Description</h2>
    <p>The subject property comprises two adjoining retail units forming part of the ground floor of a mid‑20th‑century parade.  The building has brick and concrete construction with a flat roof, glazed shopfronts to Crofton Road and rear service access.  Internally the accommodation is predominantly open‑plan retail space with areas formerly used for chilled display and storage.  To the rear there are staff areas, plant rooms and ancillary spaces.  Suspended ceilings with lay‑in mineral fibre tiles conceal services.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="methodology">
    <h2>3. Methodology</h2>
    <p>Our assessment followed recognised guidelines for property condition assessments and MEP surveys.  Key stages included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Review of documentation –</strong> available drawings and history, and Energy Performance Certificate (EPC).</li>
      <li><strong>Visual inspection –</strong> observation of building fabric, finishes and services to identify defects and signs of deterioration.</li>
      <li><strong>Interviews –</strong> discussion with site contacts (where available) regarding history, maintenance and known issues.</li>
      <li><strong>Analysis and reporting –</strong> preparation of this report including recommendations for remedial works and maintenance.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A formal property condition assessment typically covers site improvements, structural systems, building envelope, mechanical and electrical systems, plumbing systems, life safety and fire protection, vertical transportation and other considerations.  For MEP systems the scope embraces HVAC equipment, power distribution, lighting, plumbing fixtures, fire protection and extra‑low voltage systems.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="findings">
    <h2>4. Findings &amp; Observations</h2>
    <h3>4.1 Building Fabric</h3>
    <p>The retail area is currently stripped out; flooring and display shelving have been removed leaving exposed concrete surfaces.  Suspended ceiling grids are in place but many mineral fibre tiles are missing or stained, and numerous ceiling voids expose wiring and ductwork.  Internal partition walls show signs of previous alterations; to the rear, plaster finishes are damaged and damp staining is evident.  The shopfront glazing is intact but shows age‑related wear to frames and seals.  External walls appear sound; no major structural movement was observed.  Floor finishes are generally fair but worn; ceramic tiles in the staff kitchen are cracked and discoloured.</p>
    <h3>4.2 Mechanical Services</h3>
    <p>The property is served by multiple air‑conditioning units.  Ceiling cassette units and wall‑mounted fan‑coil units (manufactured by Hitachi and similar brands) are present in both the retail area and rear corridors; these units appear aged and many show physical damage, missing covers and exposed pipework.  Evidence of condensate leaks and mould staining was observed around diffusers.  Ventilation ducts run above the suspended ceiling grid; several duct branches are disconnected.  No centralised boiler plant was noted; heating appears to rely on the air‑conditioning system providing heat pump function.  Fire‑suppression equipment was limited to portable extinguishers (CO<sub>2</sub> and water) located in corridors and near exits.</p>
    <p>Air‑conditioning systems require regular inspection under the UK Energy Performance of Buildings Regulations to improve efficiency and reduce energy consumption.  Given the condition of the existing units, a detailed MEP survey should evaluate their remaining life and consider replacement with modern, efficient equipment.</p>
    <h3>4.3 Electrical Systems</h3>
    <p>The property’s electrical installation comprises a main distribution board and sub‑boards located in the rear service corridor.  Many circuit breakers are unlabeled and some covers are missing, exposing live components.  Cabling routes are untidy; numerous redundant cables remain in the ceiling void.  Lighting within the retail area is provided by recessed fluorescent luminaires, many of which are missing tubes or diffusers.  Emergency lighting is installed but its operational status could not be verified.  A small number of socket outlets in the staff kitchen are damaged or loose.</p>
    <p>Preventive maintenance is essential for electrical panels.  Inspection should check for physical damage, ensure proper labeling, tighten connections, verify GFCI protection, and test insulation and breaker function.  Given the observed deficiencies, a NICEIC‑registered electrician should test the installation and rectify non‑compliances.</p>
    <h3>4.4 Plumbing Systems</h3>
    <p>Cold water is supplied from the mains and feeds a small staff kitchenette and any former washrooms.  In the kitchenette a single stainless‑steel sink with drainer is connected to exposed copper pipework; an over‑sink water heater (instantaneous point‑of‑use) provides hot water.  The heater and pipework show signs of corrosion.  Waste pipes are partly concealed but evidence of leaks (water staining and damp patches) is apparent around the base unit.  Sanitary fittings (toilets) were locked and could not be inspected, though there were no obvious signs of recent leaks externally.</p>
    <p>Common commercial plumbing issues include clogged drains, leaks, water temperature problems and backflow incidents.  Installation of backflow prevention devices and routine maintenance of water heaters and drainage will minimise disruption.</p>
    <h3>4.5 Other Services &amp; Extra‑Low Voltage Systems</h3>
    <p>No operational lifts or escalators are present.  Extra‑low voltage systems (security alarms, CCTV and data cabling) were largely removed; a few cameras and alarm sensors remain but appear obsolete.  ELV systems operate at voltages not exceeding 50 V AC or 120 V DC and include CCTV, access control, public address and data networks.  Any future fit‑out should integrate modern ELV systems with the building’s design to enhance security and communication.</p>
    <h3>4.6 Energy Performance</h3>
    <p>An Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) is required when a building is constructed, sold or let; ratings range from A (most efficient) to G (least efficient).  The current EPC for the property was not available at the time of inspection; however, the age and condition of the mechanical and electrical systems suggest the rating is poor.  Upgrading lighting to LED, installing high‑efficiency HVAC units and improving insulation would improve the EPC.</p>
    <h3>4.7 Maintenance</h3>
    <p>The building has suffered from a lack of planned preventive maintenance.  Planned maintenance helps prevent decay and degradation, maintains structural stability and safety, optimises performance, informs future renovation plans and ensures compliance with statutory requirements.  A comprehensive planned maintenance programme should be implemented covering:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Regular inspection, cleaning and replacement of air‑conditioning units and filters.</li>
      <li>Periodic testing of electrical installations, emergency lighting and fire alarms.</li>
      <li>Inspection of plumbing systems for leaks, flushing of water heaters and cleaning of drainage runs.</li>
      <li>Monitoring of building fabric for damp ingress and timely repair of roof coverings and rainwater goods.</li>
      <li>Statutory inspections such as portable appliance testing and fire extinguisher servicing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Immediate Surrounds</h2>
    <p>Units 5–6 form part of the Princess Parade at Locksbottom, a small parade of shops on the western end of Crofton Road near the junction with Farnborough Common.  The parade comprises ground‑floor commercial units with flats above and is fronted by a public car park.  Locksbottom is served by several pubs, restaurants and a large supermarket and lies close to the Princess Royal University Hospital.  The property occupies a prominent position on Crofton Road with heavy daytime foot traffic and good visibility to passing vehicles.  Public transport connections are good: the nearest National Rail station is Orpington, about 1.8 miles away, and London Bus routes 61, 261, 336, 353, 358, R2, R3 and R4 run along Crofton Road and Farnborough Common.  Road access is excellent with direct links to the A21 and Junction 4 of the M25 motorway.  The surrounding area is predominantly suburban with established residential neighbourhoods and healthcare facilities.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="history">
    <h2>8. History of the Property &amp; Area</h2>
    <p>The wider Crofton area has ancient origins.  Archaeological evidence shows a Roman villa existed nearby between AD 140 and 400.  The name “Crofton” comes from the Old English for “farm on a rounded hill” and the locality remained largely rural until the arrival of the railway in 1868, which spurred development.  St Paul’s Church was built on Crofton Road in 1887, and extensive suburban development during the inter‑war years transformed the area into part of greater Orpington.  Locksbottom takes its name from the Lock family who owned land here in the 1700s; a workhouse constructed in 1845 later became Farnborough Hospital and was redeveloped in 2003 as the Princess Royal University Hospital.  The building housing Units 5–6 dates from around 1934 as part of a three‑storey mixed‑use parade and historically accommodated small independent retailers, including a convenience store.  These units therefore reflect the evolution of Crofton Road from farmland to suburban shopping parade and their current dilapidated state illustrates the need for investment to maintain heritage buildings.</p>

  <section id="proposed-use">
    <h2>9. Ideas for Proposed Use</h2>
    <p>Under England’s planning system, the premises fall within the broad <em>Use Class E</em> (commercial, business and service).  This category allows a wide range of uses without the need for further planning permission, including retail sale of goods, cafés and restaurants, professional and financial services, indoor sport and fitness, medical or health services, day nurseries and offices.  The open‑plan layout and prominent shopfront make the units well suited to a convenience store, bakery/patisserie, delicatessen or other speciality food retailer.  They could also be adapted to accommodate a coffee shop or casual dining outlet serving hospital staff and local residents.  Alternatively the space could be refitted as a hair or beauty salon, small gym or yoga studio, veterinary practice or community health clinic.  For professional services such as estate agency, insurance brokerage or solicitors, the location offers high visibility and good transport links.  Any proposed use should consider parking, servicing and accessibility requirements and may require consultation with the local planning authority if alterations affect external appearance or if restrictions apply.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="conclusion">
    <h2>10. Conclusions &amp; Recommendations</h2>
    <p>The property requires significant refurbishment to return it to a lettable condition.  Building fabric defects such as missing ceiling tiles, damaged partitions and worn floor finishes should be repaired.  Mechanical and electrical plant is outdated and in poor condition; replacement with high‑efficiency HVAC units and a new electrical installation is recommended.  Plumbing fixtures are basic and aged; upgrading to modern, water‑efficient fittings with proper backflow prevention is advisable.  A new fire alarm and extra‑low voltage systems (CCTV, access control) should be installed to meet current regulations.  Implementing a planned preventive maintenance regime will extend the life of assets and reduce unexpected failures.  Prior to any refurbishment, a detailed MEP survey should be commissioned to evaluate loads, capacities and compliance with relevant standards.  Subject to these works, the units can provide flexible retail or other commercial accommodation.</p>
